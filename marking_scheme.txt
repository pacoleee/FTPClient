MARKER'S ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:


----------- Non Functional Criteria

Readability

       3 marks - Code is "clean", understandable and well organized,
        with no issues.  
       2 marks - There may be minor issues with
        consistency of indentation and use of white space. variable
        naming or general organization. Although annoying, this does
        not have a major impact on readability.  
       1 mark - There are major issues with indentation, whitespace,
        variable naming 0 marks - There are major problems across
        multiple categories with respect to readability  

Documenting your code

     3 marks  - Code is well and completely commented    

     2 marks - One or two places could benefit from some additional
               comments to add clarity to what is being done.
     
     1 mark - Multiple locations where sections of code are
              uncommented or comments aren't helpful 

      0 marks - Few or no helpful comments

Code Quality

     3 marks  - Uniformly good choices of algorithms and data
                structures across all aspects of the solution

     2 marks - Good choice of algorithms or data structures except
               for 1 or 2 situations where some improvement is possible

     1 mark - Poor algorithms or data structure choice in multiple
              situations and major improvement is possible.

     0 marks - Consistently poor algorithm and data structure choices.
